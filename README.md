## What is this Project?

This application was created to demo a handful of different cloud computing solutions:

-   [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) for DNS, DDoS protection and automatic SSL security
-   [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) for VPS
-   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for authentication
-   [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) for storing/manipulating images
-   [Algolia](https://algolia.com) for search
-   [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) for building/testing/deployment
-   [StyleCI](https://styleci.io) for automatic code formatting (this is only used for PHP formatting)

## Technologies Used

The backend of this application is written in PHP, using the latest version of [Laravel](https://laravel.com), providing a REST API for handling requests from the frontend. The frontend is constructed as a Single Page Application (SPA), and is written in JavaScript, using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org).
